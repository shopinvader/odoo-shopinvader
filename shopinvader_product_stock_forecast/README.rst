This module exports the forecasted stock quantities for each product.
This data can be used by the frontend to compute virtual stocks at any given date.

The stock forecast data is a list of planned stock variations, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    [
        {"date": "2021-12-01T08:00:00", "qty": 10},
        {"date": "2021-12-02T10:00:00", "qty": -1},
        {"date": "2021-12-03T15:00:00", "qty": -4},
        {"date": "2021-12-04T11:00:00", "qty": 5},
    ]


This data can be used by aggregated and used by the frontend to compute the virtual
stock of a product at any given date.

For example, assuming the initial `qty_available` is `10`, and that today is
`2021-12-01 00:00:00`, we can infer the following:

* After `2021-12-01 08:00:00`, stock will be `20`
* After `2021-12-02 10:00:00`, stock will be `19`
* After `2021-12-03 15:00:00`, stock will be `15`
* After `2021-12-04 11:00:00`, stock will be `20`

Configuration
=============

On the Shopinvader Backend, enable the **Stock Forecast**.

Optionally, you can set a **Stock Forecast Horizon** in days to limit the
number of days to forecast.

.. warning::

    The `shopinvader_product_stock` module will let you use a different field other than
    `qty_available` to export the current stock.

    The forecast may not make sense if you don't have the proper stock to start with, so
    it's recommended not to use a different field there.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

It may be a good idea to implement a `product_stock_forecast_interval` setting,
to round and group forecasted lines.
